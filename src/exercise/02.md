# Intro to raw React APIs

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/02.md`

- React is between the programmer and the creation/managing of HTML DOM nodes (objects).
- React is a declarative. Imperative is focused on HOW (C, C++, Java), declarative is focused on WHAT (HTML, SQL). If you can not trace the code as it runs, it is declarative. JS, C#, Python are ex. of both.
- 2 React files are required. React (creating React elements), ReactDOM (translating React elements to DOM elements). Create the elements then 'attach' them to the DOM.
- Children props can contain other react nodes to render within.
  - React nodes can include strings, numbers, etc...

## Background

React is the most widely used frontend framework in the world and it's using the
same APIs that you're using when it creates DOM nodes.

React abstracts away the imperative browser API from you to give you a much more
declarative API to work with.

One important thing to know about React is that it supports multiple platforms
(for example, native and web). Each of these platforms has its own code
necessary for interacting with that platform, and then there's shared code
between the platforms.

With that in mind, you need two JavaScript files to write React applications for
the web:

- React: responsible for creating React elements (kinda like
  `document.createElement()`)
- ReactDOM: responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM (kinda like
  `rootElement.append()`)

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/02.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.html)

Let's convert this to use React! But don't worry, we won't be doing any JSX just
yet... You're going to use raw React APIs here.

In modern applications you'll get React and React DOM files from a "package
registry" like [npm](https://npmjs.com) ([react](https://npm.im/react) and
[react-dom](https://npm.im/react-dom)). But for these first exercises, we'll use
the script files which are available on [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) and
regular script tags so you don't have to bother installing them. So in the
exercise you'll be required to add script tags for these files.

Once you include the script tags, you'll have two new global variables to use:
`React` and `ReactDOM`.

Here's a simple example of the API:

```javascript
const elementProps = {id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!'}
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(elementType, elementProps)
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement)
root.render(reactElement)
```

> 🦉 NOTE: prior to React v18, the API was: `ReactDOM.render` and that's what
> you'll see in the EpicReact.dev videos. This material has been updated, so
> you'll want to use the new `ReactDOM.createRoot` API as demonstrated above.

Alright! Let's do this!

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 nesting elements

See if you can figure out how to write the JavaScript + React code to generate
this DOM output:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root">
    <div class="container">
      <span>Hello</span>
      <span>World</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```
